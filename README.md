# week-03-assignment

The main game loop being a clicker style game, with purchasable upgrades. The indication of the clicker is the pulsing (animated) summoning circle icon. An upgrade list provided alongside text indicators.

Reflection

    🎯 Fetch upgrade data from the provided API and at least one upgrade from the API update the cookie count.✔️

The only trouble that I had with this was using my own names; could there have been an easier way to alter the names from the cookie API so that I am able to more easily label my buttons.

    🎯 Ensure that functions are used effectively to keep code organised and reusable. ✔️

    🎯 Implement event listeners to handle user interactions. ✔️

    🎯 Use local storage to save and restore the cookie count and relevant game information. ✔️

    🎯 Use setInterval to increment the cookie count and manage the game state each second.
        Managing the game state includes saving progress and updating the DOM. ✔️

Design Aspects:

I phoned in the design aspects this week after having the flu for the entire time so not really having the brain capacity.

STRETCH GOALS:

🏹Consolidate upgrade management by managing all upgrades in a single function. ✔️

    So I have every purchase within the same single function and everything exists within the main game tick loop but is there a more efficient or effective way to have done everything that I have done?

🏹 Improve UX with animations, sound effects, or other visual effects. ✔️

🏹 Fantastic use of README to provide important information such as a description of the project, how to deploy and other app information. ❌

    May I ask what you mean by 'how to deploy' please?

🏹 Create a menu for users to adjust game options like sound effects or display preferences. ❌
